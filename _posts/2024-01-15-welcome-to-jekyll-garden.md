Today, I set up my personal website using Jekyll and Docker.

I wanted to learn web development so that I could set up a blog, but this way is much easier (and will probably result in a cleaner site anyways lol). I was planning to use The Odin Project. From what I've seen so far, which is not a lot, it seems quite complete in its teaching.

Starting a personal website has been something I've been wanting to do for a while, mainly as a place to share my ideas and experiences. As well, I'll also put projects and notes here.

About Setting up Jekyll:

It took a bit of patience and trial and error, and I kind of stitched together 2 tutorials. One being the [Jekyll Garden documentation](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) and the other being [Bill Raymond's Tutorial](https://gist.github.com/BillRaymond/db761d6b53dc4a237b095819d33c7332#file-dockerfile).


Anyways, thank you for reading this.
